		<p>
			Ever struggle to get that perfect temp on your steak? With sous vide, you can get the perfect steak, every time! Note that while the recipe is for one steak, this one is easily scalable for another. And of course, use any cut of beef you prefer!
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>One large Ribeye steak</li>
			<li>One tsp flour</li>
			<li>One quatre cup beef broth </li>
			<li>One tsp neutral oil (I prefer avocado oil)</li>
			<li>Six tbs of butter</li>
			<li>Spice mix consisting of one pinch of salt, pepper, and garlic powder</li>
			<li>One shallot, finely minced</li>
			<li>One cup of a cheap Cabernet. It doesn't have to be cheap nor does it have to be a cab, use which ever dry red wine you prefer, especially if you intend to drink it along with the meal! </li>
			<li>A small handfull of dark-chocolate chips. Any small pieces of dark chocolate will work, I just use chips because they're already small pieces :D</li>
			<li>Four cloves of garlic</li>
			<li>Three sprigs of both Thyme and Rosemary</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>		
			<li>Preheat your sous vide's water to your desired doneness. 120f-128f for rare, 129f-134f for medium rare, or 135f-144f for medium. 
				If you want anything more cooked than that, do you really even like steak?</li>
			<li>Rub spice mixture evenly on both sides of your steak</li>
			<li>To your sous vide cooking bag, add the steak, one tbsp of butter, and one sprig of thyme and rosemary</li>
			<li>Vacuum seal your cook bag, or if you're using a large ziplock bag, you can use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iULF9JCR3zg">water displacement method.</a></li>
			<li>Leave in the water for at least one hour, but up to four</li>
			<li>After bath time is up, remove the steak from the bag and let rest on paper towels for ten minutes. Pat dry the top of the steak as well </li>
			<li>Heat a cast iron or stainless steal pan over high heat and add your oil</li>
			<li>Once oil is smoking, add your steak to the pan and cook for sixty - ninety seconds per side. You are trying to quickly form a good crust without cooking the inside of the steak too much more. THIS WILL BE VERY SMOKEY</li>
			<li>At thirty seconds after being flipped, crank the heat off, add four tbs of butter, your garlic cloves, and your herbs</li>
			<li>Gently lift the pan and tilt it at angle so the melted butter pools, and with a spoon, gently poor the butter of the top of the steak</li>
			<li>Once your steak has had it's butter bath, remove it and set on a cooling rack for ten minutes to rest</li>
			<li>Turn the heat back on to medium with the same pan you used to sear your steak, and add your shallots.</li>
			<li>Sprinkle flour over shallots and cook until shallots have softened</li>
			<li>Turn the heat down to med-low and add wine, beef broth, the rest of your butter, and chocolate. Stir until chocolate is melted.</li>
			<li>As your sauce begins to thicken, stir, and remove large herbs and garlic cloves.</li>
			<li>Kill the heat when it reaches desired thickness</li>
			<li>Plate up your steak and spoon the sauce over top</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p><b>And thats it!&nbsp</b>This steak, and sauce go great with some mashed potatoes or asparagus!</p>
